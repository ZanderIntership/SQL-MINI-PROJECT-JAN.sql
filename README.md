# SQL Practice (Jan–Mar)

This repository contains my January–March SQL practice work based on the SQL course material prescribed for those months. It is a hands-on set of scripts and queries used to reinforce core SQL concepts through a small, realistic dataset.

## What’s in this repo

- **Database build scripts**  
  Scripts to create a sample SQL Server database (`SqlMiniProject`) and the required tables under the `app` schema (Customers, Products, Orders, OrderItems, Payments, Shipments), including keys, constraints, and indexes.

- **Data seeding scripts**  
  Insert scripts to generate sample data (customers, products, orders, order items, payments, and shipments) to support repeatable analysis and querying.

- **Practice queries (Jan–Mar)**  
  A set of queries used to practice and demonstrate topics covered in the courses, including:
  - Aggregations and grouping (e.g., revenue summaries by month/year)
  - Joins across multiple tables (customers ↔ orders ↔ payments, orders ↔ shipments, etc.)
  - CASE expressions for classification and quality checks
  - Filtering and HAVING clauses
  - Simple reporting outputs (status counts, payment-method summaries, delivery outcomes)
  - Basic data validation checks (e.g., delivered vs not delivered consistency)


## How to use

1. Run the **database/table creation** script.
2. Run the **insert/seeding** script to generate sample data.
3. Execute the **practice queries** to validate understanding and explore the dataset.

## Tech

- SQL Server (T-SQL)
- Schema: `app`
- Database: `SqlMiniProject`
